## Running
HBOS-CNV requires two input files, a bam file after sort and a reference folder,
the folder contains the reference sequence for each chromosome of the bam file.

Note: at present, the approach only supports single chromosome samples, like chr5, chrX...
The whole genomes can be detected by batch file
### runnig command
python HBOS-CNV.py [reference] [bamfile] [binSize] [chrom]

[reference]: the reference folder path

[bamfile]: a bam file after sort

[binSize]: the window size ('1000'by default)

[chrom]: Chromosome number.

### run the default example
python process2.py ./reference/ ./test.sort.bam 1000 ./output/ 21

Finally, the result files will be generated in the folder called './output/'.
